# Neo NWjsForC2
My own modern replacement for "NW.js for Construct 2".

*Icon uses the Construct 2 logo, [this Roblox hat](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/122415713240099/Sonic-Ova-Movie-Iconic-Pink-Hat), and [this cane from the Home Depot website](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Brazos-Walking-Sticks-37-in-Twisted-Walnut-Walking-Cane-502-3000-0281/205856200)*

> [!NOTE]
> - Make sure to run this with an elevated terminal.

> - Downloads may be slower than expected due to the single-threaded nature of Node.js. I'm unsure how to setup multi-threading properly, specifically for downloads, so if you know how please feel free to create a pull-request!

## Usage

- Make sure you have Contruct 2 installed, as well as Node.js and PNPM (got questions? google)

- Clone this repository and open it in an admin terminal

- Install dependencies and run `pnpm start` and let it do it's thing

- Enjoy exporting your C2 games with the latest version of NWjs!
