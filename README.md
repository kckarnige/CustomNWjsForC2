# Neo NWjs4C2
My own very scuffed installer for NW.js for Construct 2.

Make sure to run this with admin.

 Icon uses the Construct 2 logo, [this Roblox hat](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/122415713240099/Sonic-Ova-Movie-Iconic-Pink-Hat), and [this cane from the Home Depot website](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Brazos-Walking-Sticks-37-in-Twisted-Walnut-Walking-Cane-502-3000-0281/205856200)
